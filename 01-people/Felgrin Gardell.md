## Biography

### Early Life
Raised in the Church from a pious family. Lost a brother to plague, had a close personal mentor in the form of a priest who pushed him toward the Church. Was a priest of renown for years, but never the correct political choice for head priesthood on the mainland. 

### Present Day
Formed a close alliance with [[Valeria de Mendoza]] due to their shared political positions. They quickly realized they could use each other - Valeria wants to leverage Felgrin's connection to the common man, and Felgrin believes Valeria provides a way to do the most good.
